# R Programming Course for Biologists

Welcome to our R Programming Course specifically designed for biologists, including master and PhD students. This course aims to equip participants with basic R programming skills and introduce them to statistical analysis techniques applicable in molecular biology.

## Course Overview

Participants will learn through a mix of lectures, hands-on exercises, and interactive discussions. By the end of the course, you should be able to perform data manipulation, create visualizations, and conduct statistical analyses using R

### Prerequisites

Participants are expected to:

1- Have the following installed on their computers before the course begins:

You can find the installation guides once you click on them:


- [R Installation Guide](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- RStudio [RStudio Installation Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Git [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2- install the following R-libraries:
  - [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr)
  - [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown)
  - [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)
  - [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2)
  - [pheatmap](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pheatmap)
  - [dendextend](https://cran.r-project.org/web/package=dendextend)

**To install these packages, you can use the following R command:**

```r
install.packages(c("knitr", "markdown", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```
in the R Console.

3- Have a GitHub account.

## Important Installation Notice

All participants must install R, RStudio, and Git before the start of the course. These tools are essential for participating in the course exercises and for following along with the instructions.

### Trouble Installing?

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please:
- Refer to the FAQs and troubleshooting guides provided on the respective software download pages.
- Post your issue on the GitHub issues section of this repository. Please provide as much detail as possible about the problem you're experiencing.
- Contact us directly via email, and we'll do our best to assist you.

### Practice Before the Course

We strongly recommend that you try to familiarize yourself with R and RStudio by following some basic tutorials or trying out simple exercises. This will help you hit the ground running when the course starts.
